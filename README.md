This project is a Clone of my College website at [gecbh.ac.in. ](https://gecbh.ac.in/).  The Project was built from scratch finally settling on the methodologies of Bootstrap CSS and React JS after stumbling with choices of design Frameworks such as Materialize CSS, Tailwind CSS etc.  

Technologies used are - 

    Bootstrap CSS  - Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap Icons has been extensively used throughout the project.
    ReactJS
    Google Firebase - Firebase was the choice for hosting the project. 

The Live deployed example of the project is available at https://gecbhclone.web.app. 

Below are screenshots of the Desktop and Mobile View.
